# Write a method that takes a non-empty string argument, and returns the middle
# character or characters of the argument. If the argument has an odd length,
# you should return exactly one character. If the argument has an even length,
# you should return exactly two characters.
#
# Examples:
#
# center_of('I love ruby') == 'e'
# center_of('Launch School') == ' '
# center_of('Launch') == 'un'
# center_of('Launchschool') == 'hs'
# center_of('x') == 'x'

def center_of(s)
  size = s.length
  i = size / 2
  return s[i] if size.odd?
  s[(i - 1)..i]
end
# better as a ternary operator, but my solution works.

puts center_of('I love ruby') == 'e'
puts center_of('Launch School') == ' '
puts center_of('Launch') == 'un'
puts center_of('Launchschool') == 'hs'
puts center_of('x') == 'x'
