You are given a method named spin_me that takes a string as an argument and
returns a string that contains the same words, but with each word's characters
reversed. Given the method's implementation, will the returned string be the
same object as the one passed in as an argument or a different object?

1)  def spin_me(str)
2)    str.split.each do |word|
3)      word.reverse!
4)    end.join(" ")
5)  end
6)
7)  spin_me("hello world") # "olleh dlrow"

This will output a different string. We define method def_spin_me on line 1
with a String parameter named str. When we call the String#split method on line
2 on the variable string, it returns a new array with references to multiple
new String objects that are the original string split at ' '. Enumerable#each
is called, which will iterate over these new String objects in the array. So,
since the String objects are new in memory, when we call String.reverse! we are
manipulating those objects and not the original string.

At 4 we return the value returned when invoking Array#join from our split
array, with an argument of " ", which returns the array converted into a string
using " " as a spacer between items.
