For this exercise, start by using version 2.3.0 of the Ruby Array 
Documentation. If you use a more recent version of the documentation, you won't 
get the full benefit of this exercise. You don't have to install Ruby 2.3.0 - 
you can use any more recent version to test the code.

Use irb to run the following code:

  a = [5, 9, 3, 11]
  puts a.min

Find the documentation for the #min method and change the above code to print 
the two smallest values in the Array.

#min is not in 2.3.0's documentation, it is however in 2.7.0s. If you pass an integer to it, it will find that many minimums. So the new line is:

  puts a.min(2)


Apparently in 2.3.0, this was a mix in module for the Enumerable class. You can 
find it here: https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Enumerable.html

Same answer, different place.
