Locate the ruby documentation for methods File::path and File#path. How are 
they different?

https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.7.0/File.html

They are both in the documentation of the File class. ::path is a class method 
and it's called on the File class like:

File.path(path)

The #path method is an instance method that is called by an instance like this:

file_we_created.path

#path returns a string detailing the file's path, while ::path returns a string 
of the path passed to it.
