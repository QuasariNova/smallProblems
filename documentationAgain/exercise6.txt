What does this code print?

  5.step(to: 10, by: 3) { |value| puts value }

From https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.7.0/Numeric.html#method-i-step the numeric 
class we have this definition:

#step(by: step, to: limit) {|i| block } â†’ self 

It Invokes the block with the sequence of numbers starting at the num that 
called it, incremented by step on each call. The loop finishes when the value 
to be passed to the block is greater than limit if positive, or less than limit 
if negative.

So, this will pass 5 and 8. When it gets to 11, it's greater than 10, so it 
stops. So this will output:

  5
  8
