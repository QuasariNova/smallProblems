# Write another method that returns true if the string passed as an argument is
# a palindrome, false otherwise. This time, however, your method should be
# case-insensitive, and it should ignore all non-alphanumeric characters. If
# you wish, you may simplify things by calling the palindrome? method you wrote
# in the previous exercise.
#
#   Examples:
#
#   real_palindrome?('madam') == true
#   real_palindrome?('Madam') == true           # (case does not matter)
#   real_palindrome?("Madam, I'm Adam") == true # (only alphanumerics matter)
#   real_palindrome?('356653') == true
#   real_palindrome?('356a653') == true
#   real_palindrome?('123ab321') == false

def palindrome?(string)
  string == string.reverse
end

# I had to figure out a regular expression to do this correctly. Fun.
# String#delete works as well
def real_palindrome?(string)
  palindrome?(string.downcase.gsub(/[^a-z0-9]/,''))
end

puts real_palindrome?('madam') == true
puts real_palindrome?('Madam') == true           # (case does not matter)
puts real_palindrome?("Madam, I'm Adam") == true # (only alphanumerics matter)
puts real_palindrome?('356653') == true
puts real_palindrome?('356a653') == true
puts real_palindrome?('123ab321') == false
