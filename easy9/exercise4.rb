# Write a method that takes a string as an argument, and returns an Array that
# contains every word from the string, to which you have appended a space and
# the word length.

# You may assume that words in the string are separated by exactly one space,
# and that any substring of non-space characters is a word.

# p
# Given a string, return each word with it's length appended on it with a space
# in an array

# Rules
# Input: String
# Output: Array of Strings
# - Words are any substring of non-space characters separated by a single space.
# - Append string length with a signle space to each word

# e
# word_lengths("cow sheep chicken") == ["cow 3", "sheep 5", "chicken 7"]

# word_lengths("baseball hot dogs and apple pie") ==
#   ["baseball 8", "hot 3", "dogs 4", "and 3", "apple 5", "pie 3"]

# word_lengths("It ain't easy, is it?") ==
# ["It 2", "ain't 5", "easy, 5", "is 2", "it? 3"]

# word_lengths("Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious") ==
#   ["Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious 34"]

# word_lengths("") == []

# d
# String, Array

# a
# - Given string str
# - Seperate string by words into Array words
# - Iterate over Array of words appending each word's length to the string
# - return array
